# Node.js working example

## JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Google Cloud | Node.js

This is a working example of a Node.js deployment on Google Cloud.
It renders my homepage in an iFrame within a html file.
This html file is loaded once the user sends a get-request to the url where the javascript file is stored.
Herein an end point is defined and the app listens to port 3000, so this runtime can also be executed locally on your machine with a browser.

In future, more complex apps will be showcased here.
